Welcome to Data Visualization in R! We'll be using a dataset from the Pew Research Center's [Forum on Religion & Public Life](http://www.pewforum.org/), a country-wide survey from 2014 Americans' religious beliefs. You can download the data [from Pew](http://www.pewforum.org/datasets/) or my [GitHub page](https://github.com/markchand/Religion-in-America) (sorry Pew!). 

## Importing data
Importing data looks like this: 

```{r import}
library(haven)
pew <- read_sav("Pew-Research-Center-2014-U.S.-Religious-Landscape-Study/Dataset - Pew Research Center 2014 Religious Landscape Study National Telephone Survey - Version 1.1 - December 1 2016.sav")
```

<!-- A quick note on packages: library(haven) is a package that helps us import files with a .sav extension. In general, if you have not used a package before, you'll have to first install it on your machine using the command structure install.packages("haven"). After that, you'll call that package into a project using the structure library("haven"). -->

<!-- A quick note on my quick note: Notice that if you use "<!--" symbols it will comment out text in a markdown document, the same way that adding "#" will do it in a chunk. Don't forget these symbols at the end: --> 

To visualize this data we will be using a package called ggplot2, which is included in a package of packages called *tidyverse*:

```{r tidy, results='hide', error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## A Roadmap for today (and some conceptual stuff) 

While we're all getting set up, here's a roadmap for the afternoon:  

* R and plot() versus tidyverse and ggplot2 
* ggplot and the grammar of graphics
* Principles of pretty visualizations 
* Getting data into shape with dplyr  
* Using ggplot to examine your data 

## Getting to know your data 

The Pew data comes with a codebook from which we'll pick out a few variables to work with. If you want to see some information about the variables at once, you *could* do some of these things: 

```{r head, eval=FALSE}
summary(pew)
pairs(pew)
corr(pew)
```

... but you don't want to do any of those things in a dataset with this many variables. You can check out the names and basic structure of a dataset with `str()`. 

```{r str, eval=FALSE}
str(pew)
# A quick note here: eval=FALSE will prevent the code chunk from providing any output into your markdown document. 
```

## Charts and things 

Let's start with the basics: a histogram of religious affiliation, the simplest version of this is the variable "RELTRAD." 

```{r bars}
ggplot(pew, aes(RELTRAD)) + geom_bar()
```

That didn't work! Why not? This a pretty normal mistake that I regularly make: The data I want to use is stored as integers rather than text (characters), and different `geoms` require different kinds of data. If we look at the data in the codebook, we also see that the data is in a format unhelpful to our visualization. We need to use the codebook to transform the data into something useful, using the `mutate` and `case_when` commands from dplyr, another package in the tidyverse. 

```{r mutate}
pew %>% 
  mutate(
    RELTRAD2 = case_when(
  RELTRAD == 1100 ~ "Evangelical Protestant Tradition", 
  RELTRAD == 1200 ~ "Mainline Protestant Tradition",
  RELTRAD == 1300 ~ "Historically Black Protestant Tradition", 
  RELTRAD == 10000 ~ "Catholic",
  RELTRAD == 20000 ~ "Mormon",
  RELTRAD == 30000 ~ "Orthodox Christian",
  RELTRAD == 40001 ~ "Jehovah's Witness",
  RELTRAD == 40002 ~ "Other Christian",
  RELTRAD == 50000 ~ "Jewish",
  RELTRAD == 60000 ~ "Muslim",
  RELTRAD == 70000 ~ "Buddhist", 
  RELTRAD == 80000 ~ "Hindu",
  RELTRAD == 90001 ~ "Other World Religions",
  RELTRAD == 90002 ~ "Other Faiths",
  RELTRAD == 100000 ~ "Unaffiliated (religious 'nones')",
  RELTRAD == 900000 ~ "Don't know/refused - no information on religious identity")) -> pew
```

```{r bars take two}
ggplot(pew, aes(RELTRAD2)) + geom_bar()
```

That's still pretty terrible looking. We want to do something like this:

Let's clean our plot up with code options from ggplot. Run the code below in stages: After `geom_bar()`, highlight one additional row every time you rune the code to watch what happens. 

```{r bars cleaning up}
ggplot(pew, aes(x = fct_infreq(RELTRAD2))) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(y="Number of Respondents", x="") + 
  ggtitle( "Prevalence of Religions in the United States", subtitle = "Source: Pew Religion Survey, 2014") + 
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

Better! Let's try another one. We know now that we'll need to do some mutating in order to take a look at the relationship between age and ideology in the survey: 

```{r more mutating}
pew %>% 
  mutate(
    agerec2 = case_when(
  agerec == 1 ~ "Age 24 or younger",
  agerec == 2 ~ "Age 25-29",
  agerec == 3 ~ "30-34",
  agerec == 4 ~ "35-39",
  agerec == 5 ~ "40-44",
  agerec == 6 ~ "45-49",
  agerec == 7 ~ "50-54",
  agerec == 8 ~ "55-59",
  agerec == 9 ~ "60-64",
  agerec == 10 ~ "65-69",
  agerec == 11 ~ "70-74",
  agerec == 12 ~ "75-79",
  agerec == 13 ~ "80-84",
  agerec == 14 ~ "85-89",
  agerec == 15 ~ "Age 90 or older",
  agerec == 99 ~ "NA")
  ) -> pew
```

```{r age}
ggplot(pew, aes(agerec2)) + geom_bar()
```

Not cool. Let's clean things up a bit and plot again: 

```{r ugh fine}
pew %>% 
  mutate(
    agerec2 = case_when(
  agerec == 1 ~ "24 or younger",
  agerec == 2 ~ "25-29",
  agerec == 3 ~ "30-34",
  agerec == 4 ~ "35-39",
  agerec == 5 ~ "40-44",
  agerec == 6 ~ "45-49",
  agerec == 7 ~ "50-54",
  agerec == 8 ~ "55-59",
  agerec == 9 ~ "60-64",
  agerec == 10 ~ "65-69",
  agerec == 11 ~ "70-74",
  agerec == 12 ~ "75-79",
  agerec == 13 ~ "80-84",
  agerec == 14 ~ "85-89",
  agerec == 15 ~ "90 or older",
  agerec == 99 ~ "NA"),
    ideo2 = case_when(
  ideo == 1 ~ "1 - Very conservative",
    ideo == 2 ~ "2 - Conservative",
    ideo == 3 ~ "3 - Moderate",
    ideo == 4 ~ "4 - Liberal",
    ideo == 5 ~ "5 - Very liberal",
    ideo == 9 ~ "NA")) -> pew
```

```{r age take two}
ggplot(subset(pew, agerec2!="NA" & ideo2!="NA"), aes(agerec2, fill = ideo2)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(y="Number of Respondents", x="Age Group", fill="Ideology") + 
  ggtitle( "Political Identification by Age", subtitle = "Source: Pew Religion Survey, 2014") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_manual(breaks = c("1 - Very conservative", "2 - Conservative", "3 - Moderate","4 - Liberal","5 - Very liberal"), values=c("red","dark red","purple4","dark blue","blue"))
```

Now we're getting somewhere! 

## Animated graphics with ggplot and gganimate 

Now, just for kicks: When I'm well-caffeinated, I always take a first stab at *one* thing that I'd like to learn how to do but don't understand yet. This time I wanted to try gganimate: 

```{r animating fails, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(gganimate)
p <- ggplot(subset(pew, agerec2!="NA" & ideo2!="NA"), aes(ideo2)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  labs(y="Number of Respondents", x="") + 
  ggtitle( "Political Identification by Age", subtitle = "Source: Pew Religion Survey, 2014")

p + transition_time(agerec2) +
  labs(title = "Age Group: {frame_time}")
  
install.packages("gifski")
library(gifski)
  
p + transition_time(agerec2) +
  labs(title = "Age Group: {frame_time}")   

install.packages("png")
library(png)  

p + transition_states(agerec2)
```

```{r gganimate, warning=FALSE}
library(gganimate)
p <- ggplot(subset(pew, agerec2!="NA" & ideo2!="NA"), aes(ideo2, fill = ideo2)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  labs(y="Number of Respondents", x="") + 
  ggtitle( "Political Identification by Age", subtitle = "Source: Pew Religion Survey, 2014")  +
  scale_fill_manual(breaks = c("1 - Very conservative", "2 - Conservative", "3 - Moderate","4 - Liberal","5 - Very liberal"), values=c("red","dark red","purple4","dark blue","blue"))

p + transition_states(agerec2) +
  labs(title = "Americans' Political Ideology by Age: {closest_state}") 
```
